- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Aurelia. You can <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/aurelia" target="_blank">pronounce my name</a> in one of two ways; I don't mind either.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C# and web development with <b>Code Kentucky</b>.
- ðŸ”§ I like to tinker (including with code). Hopefully I don't break too many things in the process.
- ðŸ“« Reach me via <a href="mailto:findaurelia@live.com">email</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aurelia-ang-dyson/">LinkedIn</a>.
